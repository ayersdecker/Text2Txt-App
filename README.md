# Text2Txt-App

### **Release 1.0 coming May 1st 2023!**

>**What does it do?**

A mobile application that simplifies text for better understanding or more approachable steps. It is as simple as opening the app, pointing your camera at the text or pasting text from clipboard, and clicking send.
  
Text2Txt uses several different technologies, the most notable being OpenAI’s Chat GPT 3.5 Turbo, Tesseract OCR, and SyncFusion Libraries. The application is built using the .NET MAUI platform, released for both Android and iOS. Future production will include a UWP/WinUI product that will be available on the Windows App Store.
  
>**Who is it for?**

This application is for everyone! If you ever need to break up difficult documents into easy to approach steps, or if something is written at a reading level akin to Shakespeare or Homer, this app is for you! Text 2 Txt is free to use on any smart device supported in the application release. 

>**System Requirements**

- Internet connection
- Camera Access
- Clipboard Permissions

>**Project Information**

Text2Txt is designed as a part of the Mobile Application Development 2 Course at RIT/NTID. This free to use software is meant to showcase topics learned during the Spring 2023 semester. The application will not be monetized as a part of the program limitations. For more information about this project’s history and documentation, please visit the project website at
