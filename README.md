### **What does it do?**

A mobile application that simplifies text for better understanding or more approachable steps. It is as simple as opening the app, pointing your camera at the text or pasting text from clipboard, and clicking send.
  
Text2Txt uses several different technologies, the most notable being OpenAI’s Chat GPT 3.5 Turbo, Tesseract OCR, and SQLite. The application is built using the .NET MAUI platform, released for Android 10.0 or Newer. Future production will include a UWP/WinUI product that will be available on the Windows App Store.

### **Who is it for?**

This application is for everyone! If you ever need to break up difficult documents into easy to approach steps, or if something is written at a reading level akin to Shakespeare or Homer, this app is for you! Text 2 Txt is free to use on any smart device supported in the application release.
