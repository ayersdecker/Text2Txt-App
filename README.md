### **What does it do?**

A mobile application that simplifies text for better understanding or more approachable steps. It is as simple as opening the app, pointing your camera at the text or pasting text from clipboard, and clicking send.
  
Text2Txt uses several different technologies, the most notable being OpenAI’s Davinci 3, Tesseract OCR, and other libraries. The application is built using the .NET MAUI platform, released for Android 12.0 or Newer. Future production will include a UWP/WinUI product that will be available on the Windows App Store.
